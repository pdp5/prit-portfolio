              I’m passionate about playing volleyball, particularly during the
              winter months when I enjoy spending time with friends on the
              court. Whether it's a friendly match or a competitive game,
              volleyball brings me joy and allows me to stay active. I also
              participate in local-level volleyball tournaments, where I can
              showcase my skills, work as part of a team, and embrace the
              challenges of competition. This activity not only helps me stay
              physically fit but also teaches valuable lessons in teamwork,
              discipline, and perseverance, which I carry with me in all areas
              of my life.

              I have a deep love for music and dance. I enjoy singing and
              playing the guitar, although I haven’t learned them
              professionally. Instead, I’ve dedicated countless hours practicing
              through YouTube tutorials, constantly refining my skills. My love
              for dancing is equally strong, and I’m fortunate to participate in
              annual events organized by the temple I regularly attend. These
              events offer my friends and me the chance to learn new dances and
              perform in front of a large audience, fostering creativity and
              teamwork. These activities not only allow me to express myself but
              also contribute to my personal growth and discipline.
